        <p> My name is David, Ejiro David and since I have nothing to say about myself I'll just plugin my favourite quote, Its one from Ralph Waldo Emerson:<br><br> To laugh often and much;
          to win the respect of the intelligent people
          and the affection of children;
          to earn the appreciation of honest critics and endure the betrayal of false friends;
          to appreciate beauty;
          to find the best in others;
          to leave the world a bit better whether by a healthy child,
          a garden patch,
          or a redeemed social condition;
          to know that one life has breathed easier because you lived here.
          This is to have succeeded. </p><img src="img/me.jpeg"

      <h3>My Skills, Services and Hobbies</h3>
      <p>I'm a web developer, which means I build the places you visit on your browser. I do this with a technology stack consisting of HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript for added dynamic features. I can build you a landing page for your latest product, a tribute page and maybe a blog or something. When I'm not coding I'm either reading a good book (like something by Haruki Murakami) or taking pictures of Nature and Happy People. (Sunsets and Smiling faces are my favourite) </p>
